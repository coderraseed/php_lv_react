/*
Operator Precedence

The precedence of an operator specifies how "tightly" it binds two expressions together. For example, in the expression 1 + 5 * 3, the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication ("*") operator has a higher precedence than the addition ("+") operator. Parentheses may be used to force precedence, if necessary. For instance: (1 + 5) * 3 evaluates to 18.

When operators have equal precedence their associativity decides how the operators are grouped. For example "-" is left-associative, so 1 - 2 - 3 is grouped as (1 - 2) - 3 and evaluates to -4. "=" on the other hand is right-associative, so $a = $b = $c is grouped as $a = ($b = $c).

Arithmetic Assignment Operators
Example      Equivalent           Operation
$a += $b     $a = $a + $b         Addition
$a -= $b     $a = $a - $b         Subtraction
$a *= $b     $a = $a * $b         Multiplication

$a ^= $b     $a = $a ^ $b         Bitwise Xor
$a <<= $b    $a = $a << $b        Left Shift
$a >>= $b    $a = $a >> $b        Right Shift
